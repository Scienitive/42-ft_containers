# 42-ft_containers

**Score: 100/100**

This project is about recoding some containers from STL in C++98.

## Features

# Vector

A dynamic array that can expand its own capacity when needed. Works just like an array. Elements can be easily accessed because the data is stored in a row, but it's not an optimal container if a lot of insertion and (especially) deletion are needed.

# Map

A sorted container that uses Red-Black Tree (a self-balancing tree model). Works like a dictionary, with a key and a value. Great container type for searching through large data.

# Stack

A container that works just like a box (LIFO, last in first out). It uses vector as its underlying container but you can specify any container type upon creation.
